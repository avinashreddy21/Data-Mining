# Linear Regression and Decision Tree Classification models

Datasets “
PB1_train.csv” and “PB1_test.csv” have three columns first two columns are the features
x =[x 1 ,x 2 ]) and the last column is the prediction value (y). The hypotheses formula is given
y = θ<sub>0</sub> + θ<sub>1</sub> x<sub>1</sub> + θ<sub>2</sub> x<sub>2</sub>
Train a linear regression model,
M, over x and y values from “PB1_train.csv” and report the
corresponding model parameters ( θ<sub>0</sub> , θ<sub>1</sub> and θ<sub>2</sub> ).
Test model
Test model MM on on ““PB1_test.csvPB1_test.csv” ” and report the predicted and report the predicted values (values (y̅)) forfor each row. Calculate the each row. Calculate the meanmean--squaredsquared--error between the predicted values and error between the predicted values and original values (third column in “PB1_test.csv”).original values (third column in “PB1_test.csv”).
