# Data-Mining

Data mining involves Data preprocessing, Data transformation, Measures of similarity and accuracy, Data classification algorithms like k-nearest neighbor, Naive-bayes, Decision Tree, SVM
, and Neural Networks, Data CLustering like k-means clustering, spectral clustering, and hierarchical clustering.

The following are the tasks performed as part of Data mining course.

* Task 1 : Correlation

* Task 2 : Clustering from scratch

* Task 3 : Clustering

* Task 4 : Linear Regression and Decision Tree Classification/Prediction

* Task 5 : Naive-Bayes and SVM Classification/Prediction
