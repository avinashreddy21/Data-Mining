# Naive-Bayes and Support Vector Machine Classification

In this classification problem, a Naïve Bayes classifier is trained that predicts whether a
person is male (represented as 0) or female (represented as 1), given three f eatures: height (in centi
meters), age and weight (in kilograms).

Used “PB1_train.csv”, “PB2_train.csv”  and “PB1_test.csv”, “PB2_test.csv” for this task, where the first three columns represent three features (height, age, weight), 
and the fourth column represent class label (0/1).

Trained a Naïve-Bayes classifier on “PB1_train.csv” and “PB2_train.csv” data that learns to map the mentioned features to their corresponding class values.

Reported the predicted values (y̅) and accuracy percentage (percentage of matches) of the model by testing it on “PB1_test.csv” and “PB2_test.csv” data.

In the SVM classification,
Trained three SVM classifier SV1 SV2 and SV3 on “PB1_train.csv” and “PB1 _train.csv” data that learns to map the mentioned features to their corresponding class values.

Reported the predicted values (y̅) and accuracy percentage (percentage of matches) for each model by testing it on “PB1_test.csv” and “PB1_test.csv” data.

SV1 configuration : kernel type = 'linear'
SV2 configuration : kernel type = 'poly nomial', Degree of the polynomial kernel function = 5
SV3 configuration : kernel type = 'radial basis function' or 'rbf'
